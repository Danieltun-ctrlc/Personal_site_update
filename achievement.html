                    Republic Polytechnic organized a module called G121 Innovation and Practice, where students were tasked with selecting one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and developing an innovative solution to address it. Our team chose the Quality Education goal and created an application called HushWave. This app is designed to <span style="color: blue">enhance learning by providing a more focused and distraction-free environment.</span> Our innovative approach and the potential impact of HushWave earned us the prestigious Outstanding Innovation Award, which is granted only to the few teams with groundbreaking ideas that have the potential to make a significant impact.

                    I was introduced to the Republic Polytechnic bootcamp, where I embarked on a journey to learn programming. One of my biggest goals was to create a meaningful project, and achieving that now fills me with joy and hope. During the bootcamp, I worked on a project that utilized digital tools and technology to address real-world challenges. Specifically,<span style="color: blue;"> our project focused on using digital solutions to tackle issues related to clean water and sanitation,</span> helping to raise awareness and provide innovative ways to ensure access to safe and sustainable water sources for communities in need.
